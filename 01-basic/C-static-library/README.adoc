# Introduction

Shows a hello world example which first creates and links a static library. This is a 
simplified example showing the library and binary in the same folder. Typically
these would be in sub-projects as described in section link:../../02-sub-projects[02-sub-projects]

The files in this tutorial are below:

```
$ tree
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── include
│   └── static
│       └── Hello.h
└── src
    ├── Hello.cpp
    └── main.cpp
```

  * link:CMakeLists.txt[] - Contains the CMake commands you wish to run
  * link:include/static/Hello.h[] - The header file to include
  * link:src/Hello.cpp[] - A source file to compile
  * link:src/main.cpp[] - The source file with main


# Concepts

## Adding a Static Library(创建静态库)

The +add_library()+ function is used to create a library from some source files.（the 
+add_library()+命令通过若干个源文件创建库）
This is called as follows:

[source,cmake]
----
add_library(hello_library STATIC 
    src/Hello.cpp
)
----

This will be used to create a static library with the name libhello_library.a with
the sources in the +add_library+ call.

[NOTE]
====
As mentioned in the previous example, we pass the source files directly to the
+add_library+ call（直接把源文件传递给+add_library命令）, as recommended for modern CMake.
====

## Populating Including Directories（填充包括目录）

In this example, we include directories in the library（我们把（头）文件放入库中） using the +target_include_directories()+ function with the scope set to +PUBLIC+.

[source,cmake]
----
target_include_directories(hello_library
    PUBLIC 
        ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/include
        #${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}路径
)
----

This will cause the included directory used in the following places:

* When compiling the library（当编译库时）
* When compiling any additional target that links the library.（当编译任何链接该库的目标时）

The meaning of scopes are（作用域如下）:

* +PRIVATE+ - the directory is added to this target's include directories（这个文件被
添加到目标的“包括目录下”）
* +INTERFACE+ - the directory is added to the include directories for any targets that link this library.
（接口 这个文件被添加到“包括目录”下为任何链接到这个库的目标使用）
* +PUBLIC+ - As above, it is included in this library and also any targets that link this library.
（同时添加到库的“包括目录”和目标的“包括目录”下）

[TIP]
====
For public headers it is often a good idea to have your include folder be "namespaced"
with sub-directories（？？？）. 

The directory passed to +target_include_directories+ will be the root of your 
include directory tree and your C++ files should include the path from there to your header.

For this example you can see that we do it as follows:
[source,cpp]
----
#include "static/Hello.h"
----

Using this method means that there is less chance of header filename clashes when
you use multiple libraries in your project. 
====

## Linking a Library（链接一个库）

When creating an executable that will use your library you must tell the compiler
about the library（当创建一个使用某库的可执行文件时需要告诉编译器你要用这个库）. This 
can be done using the +target_link_libraries()+ function.

[source,cmake]
----
add_executable(hello_binary 
    src/main.cpp
)

target_link_libraries( hello_binary
    PRIVATE  
        hello_library
)
----

This tells CMake to link the hello_library against the hello_binary executable
during link time. It will also propagate(传播) any include directories with +PUBLIC+ or +INTERFACE+ scope
 from the linked library target.

An example of this being called by the compiler is

```
/usr/bin/c++ CMakeFiles/hello_binary.dir/src/main.cpp.o -o hello_binary -rdynamic libhello_library.a
```
